description3: "I am a passionate Master's Candidate in Data Science at Tufts University with a focus on Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI. Experienced in using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras, I aspire to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques to real-world problems. In the summer of 2023, I further deepened my expertise by working on advanced projects involving spiking neural networks and large language models, including Falcon, LLaMA, Vicuna, Guanuco, and GPT-4 from OpenAI. My previous solid foundation in software development includes expert-level proficiency in Web and Mobile Development, specifically with React, React Native, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I also possess strong back-end skills with experience in Symfony, PHP, MySQL, and MongoDB, particularly on AWS cloud infrastructure. My goal is to combine my software development experience with my machine learning expertise to create impactful, data-driven solutions."
